## 1. Repository description

This project provides homework solutions for the Algorithm Analysis course
taught at [Politehnica University of Bucharest](https://upb.ro), during the
first semester of the university year 2020-2021.

I created this repository for the following reasons:

1. the huge efforts I put in the [LCA Analysis](homework/1)
2. personal interest in the suject

For more information or a syllabus check out the course description

. This course was taught by Ștefan Trăușan-Matu.
